## Lessons from Australia's Port Arthur Massacre

The Tipping Point is a D3 visualization that centers on the story of the Port Arthur massacre and how it changed the conversation around gun control. The Tipping Point features three visualizations that walk the user through the story, the changes in gun ownership and deaths in Australia and the United States, and a comparative map of contemporary gun data in the United States.
